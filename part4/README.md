- `pure_shear.ipynb`  
  Use a pure shear test to validate code performance, compare to an analytical solution.

- `mesh_refinement.ipynb`  
  Use `full_example_2` to illustrate $h$- and $p$-refinement.

- `failed_example.ipynb`  
  Show how a low-quality mesh can lead to an ill-conditioned stiffness matrix.
